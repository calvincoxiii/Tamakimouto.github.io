*       I need to figure out what I'm going to do with the e-mail icon,
        I could have it hover up and display an address under it.

*       I need to fix the colors for the title, and in general get better colors.

*       In the future it would be nice to have a weather system, but I wouldn't
        know where to get the art for that.

*       For some reason the music div displays differently on my browser than
        other browsers, its taller on other people's screens (bad)

*       I should have a new logo in the future.

*       I want a follow-sprite on the right hand side. I have no clue where
        to get art for this, it has to be a gif so it looks dynamic.
