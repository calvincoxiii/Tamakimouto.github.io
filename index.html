          <span class="hilight">I'm Anthony</span>,
          a programmer who also happens to do web development.
          I enjoy working in the system level and occasionally doing web design.
          I dabble in various open source projects ... sometimes prorietary but that's
          only on special occasion.
          <br><br>
          <span class="hilight">Most of what I do</span>
          is in hopes of creating something useful and amusing.
          My favorite language is C, but I do feel pretty good writing
          LISP. From a web perspective, the LAMP Stack is where it's at;
          I've mainly been doing backend, but can venture into front end.
          <br><br>
          <span class="hilight">As a person</span>
          I'm pretty self sufficient, however I don't mind, and prefer to work in
          teams. Lasting friendships are built on teamwork and overall productivity
          is increased with everyone looking out for one another.
          <br><br>
          <span class="shy hilight">
            And if you don't mind, let's be friends.
